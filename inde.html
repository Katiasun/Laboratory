            <p>
              When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
              collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
              integrated, iterative and agile. <br />
              Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
              create exceptional products. We start each project by
              understanding your business goals, the user’s needs and the
              product requirements. Then we help translate them into effective
              and elegant solutions.

            Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will
            spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.
            The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level
            statement of work. <br />
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or
            just the pieces you need.

              <p>
                Our design practice offers a full range of services including
                branding strategy, interaction and visual design and user
                experience testing. Throughout your project, our designers
                create and implement visual designs and workflows, solicit user
                feedback, and work with you to make sure what gets built is what
                is needed.

                All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and
                web development technologies. They collaborate with your team to
                write, test, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven
                practices such as test-driven development and pair programing.

                Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
                coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go
                live. This iterative process allows for changes as business
                requirements evolve.
